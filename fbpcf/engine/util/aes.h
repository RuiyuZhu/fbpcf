/*
AES algorithm can be divided into two parts:
1. key schedule
2. encryption/decryption

A scheduled key can be repeatedly used as the original key doesn't change.
Scheduling a key takes a significant portion of the total workload in
AES cipher. Therefore it would significantly improve the performance if
key scheduling can be amortized.

Existing SIMD instructions treat every __m128i register as an AES block.
As shown on Intel website
(https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#text=mm_aes&expand=2428,5304,5944,238,230)
AES encryption/decryption rounds can be executed in a signal instruction:
  * __m128i _mm_aesenc_si128 (Block a, __m128i RoundKey)
    Perform one round of an AES encryption flow on data (state) in a using the
round key in RoundKey, and store the result in dst.

  * __m128i _mm_aesenclast_si128 (Block a, __m128i RoundKey)
    Perform the last round of an AES encryption flow on data (state) in a using
the round key in RoundKey, and store the result in dst.

  * __m128i _mm_aesdec_si128 (Block a, __m128i RoundKey)
    Perform one round of an AES decryption flow on data (state) in a using the
round key in RoundKey, and store the result in dst.

  * __m128i _mm_aesdeclast_si128 (Block a, __m128i RoundKey)
    Perform the last round of an AES decryption flow on data (state) in a using
the round key in RoundKey, and store the result in dst.

   * Compute the difference between two batches of shared values.

   * The second value(s) are additive-shared.
   * The batch of difference also need to multiply with a batch of sign
   * indicators (positive/negative one). The indicators are also
   * additively-shared.
   * For each instance in the batch, the formula is
   * result = (indicatorShare_0-indicatorShare_1)*((minuend_0 xor
   * minuend_1)-(subtrahend_0 - subtrahend_1))
   * @param indicatorShares a batch of additively shared indicatorShare, it is
   * guaranteed that indicatorShare_0-indicatorShare_1 \in {-1, 1};
   * @param minuendShares a vector of batches of XOR shared values (from less
   * significant to more significant), they can be converted to secret type T.
   * XOR shares are used here since itâ€™s the easiest way to extract a shared
   * secret from a XOR-secret share engine. In other use cases we may need to
   * adopt other secret share schemes. The vector of vectors is in the following
   * format {[vector of 0-th bit in all shares], [vector of 1-th bit in all
   * shares], [vector of 2-th bit in all shares], ..., [vector of last bit in
   * all shares]}
   * @param subtrahendShares a vector of batches of additively shared values
